Ever wondered why any particular module ended up in a resulting bundle? WhyBundled is here to answer exactly this question.

It is meant to be used alognside with [stats report from webpack](https://webpack.js.org/api/stats/).

## Quick Start

```sh
npm i -g whybundled

whybundled stats.json ← stats file generated by wepback
```

## Usage

```sh
Usage
  $ whybundled stats.json [pattern]                 [default command]
  $ whybundled stats.json --by styled-components    [by command]

Default options:
  [pattern]          Optional pattern used to filter output to only matched modules
  --modulesOnly      Only include modules
  --filesOnly        Only include files
  --directOnly       Only include direct dependencies
  --transitiveOnly   Only include transitive dependencies
  --duplicatesOnly   Only include modules that have duplicates in a resulting bundle
  --limit            Limits output of reasons and files [default: 20]

By options [--by]:
  --limit            Limits output of reasons and files [default: 20]

Other options:
  -v, --version      Shows version.
  --help             Shows help.

Examples
  $ whybundled stats.json --modulesOnly
```

## Features

### Stats Analyzes

* Outputs list of all modules/files included in the bundle in from most imported to least imported order.
* Build a chain of dependencies for transitive dependencies.
* Shows all files that were included for particular module.
* Shows all reasons why particular module was included.

```sh
MODULE  isobject
├─ imported: 1 time     ← number of times module imported
├─ type: [transitive]   ← type of a dependency can be either direct or transitive
│  └─ isobject -> is-plain-object -> styled-components    ← for transitive dependencies whybundled outputs a chain of dependencies up to closest direct
│
├─ locations:  ← where module is located in a project
│  └─ ../node_modules/isobject/
│
├─ files:      ← list of files that were included for this module
│  └─ ../node_modules/isobject/index.js
│
└─ reasons:    ← list of reasons why module was included in a resulting bundle
   └─ is-plain-object
      └─ ../node_modules/is-plain-object/index.js  10:15-34  [cjs require]
```

### Duplicates Badge

If module has been bundled several times from different locations whybundled adds `[multiple]` badge next to locations field:

### Brought by

Using `--by` flag whybundled shows all modules that were brought into resulting bundle by a particular module:

```sh
whybundled stats.json --by styled-components
```
